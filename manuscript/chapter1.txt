# Chapter 1: Introduction


## Who should read this book
This book is for anyone curious about 3d printing, for the purpose of completing a specific project or anything in-between.  The book is broken down into two major sections.  The first section is an introduction to the process of designing 3d models and printing these objects.  The second part of the book is a collection of projects selected to exercise the skills taught by the first part and to give you an overview of the sort of applications 3D printing can be used for.

You are encouraged to jump-around and read chapters that cover subjects you'd like to learn more about, or particular areas where you'd like to improve on your current work.  You may like to dive directly into the example projects.  Each project references the relevant chapters in the first section of the book that explain the underlying principles or techniques involved in completing the project should you need additional information.


## What is 3D printing?
3D printing is the process of turning an electronic three-dimensional model into a real, physical, tangible object.

This is only slightly more complex than familiar two-dimensional printing like this page.

For example, when writing an email you are creating an electronic model of a two-dimensional object.  This model contains enough information to know what space on the sheet of paper need to be filled in with ink (the printed area) and what space can be left blank (the page you are printing on).  Inside your printer, the model (email) is read line-by-line and a printhead in the printer squirts ink on the paper one line at a time.  As each letter is printed, the print head moves and prints the next letter.  This is the "X" axis.  When the end of a line is reached, the paper is moved and the print head prints the next line.  This is the "Y" axis.  At the end of the model file (email), the printer moves the paper along the Y axis to eject the paper.  A more complicated model might include information about multiple colors and complex formatting like tables, pictures, etc.

If you were to print this email using your printer, the result would be a physical, tangible object built from the 2d model you created.

![A typical computer printer the ink cartridge moves along the the X axis while the paper moves along the Y axis](images/chapter_1/3dprintingwithreprap01_03.jpg)

3D printing is strikingly similar.  It simply adds a third axis, the "Z" axis.  First, a model is constructed using modeling software (just as an email is constructed using an email program, or a document is constructed using a word processor).  The model is sent to the printer and read line-by-line, moving the printhead along the X and Y axis creating a the first layer of the print, just like the 2d printer.  Instead of ink, plastic is *extruded* (a fancy word for "squeezed through a hole") onto the print surface until the layer is complete.

![The 3D printer adds a third axis (Z) to add depth](images/chapter_1/3dprintingwithreprap01_04.jpg)

When the first layer is complete, instead of ejecting the print surface (as the paper was ejected in the 2d printing example), the print head then moves upward along the Z axis and prints another layer on top of the first.  This repeats until the end of the model file is reached and the completed object is ejected from the printer.


## What you'll need for projects
If you plan to complete the projects, here is what you will need:

* A computer
* Access to a 3D printer (either your own, a friend's, at a local hackerspace or via a printing service as discussed in Chapter 5
* A notebook
* A camera

Other tools may come in handy, and will be described in the chapters where they are introduced (a complete list of tools is included in Appendix A).

The two most important tools of course are your own interest in the subject and patience.  3D printing has been around a while, but its use at home is a very young practice and should always be looked at as experimental.  By taking this attitude toward your projects the work will be more pleasant and less frustrating.  If you look at each print in terms of what you can learn from it (as opposed to achieving a specific result) you'll enjoy it a lot more.


## What is Reprap?
A RepRap is a type of 3d printer defined by one characteristic: it is designed to be capable of producing copies of itself.  This might sound fantastic, but to varying degrees, all RepRap printers are able to produce some percentage of the parts necessary to create replicas of themselves.  There is two key benefits to this approach:  The first is that 3D printers encompass almost all of the components found in modern technology (mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software development, etc.).  A machine capable of producing a 3D printer should be capable of producting almost anything.  The second (and perhaps more important) is that a printer that can reproduce makes 3D printing technology avaliable to a much wider audience than machines which need to be built in specialized factories.  In this way a RepRap is akin to a seed, which when planted produces a bushel of fruit which in turn bear additional seeds.  I call this the "Johnny Appleseed" effect, and not only does it allow more people to utilize the power of 3D printing, but it allows forces of evolution to directly improve the printers generation after generation.  This evolution is only possible because the RepRap is Open Source project, which means that anyone can make a copy or a modification without fear of violating a patent, copyright or other intellectual property law.


## Anatomy of a 3D printer
3D printers are evolving rapidly.  By the time you read this, there will undoubtedly be printers available that didn't exist when this book went to press.  There are a number of components that most 3D printers share, either literally or at least conceptually.


### Print head
Print head is a general term that is not used often in conversation about 3D printing.  Typically more printer-specific terms are used.  The principle of a print head exists in all current 3D printer designs.  The heads' job is to deposit material in a precise fashion in the location it is placed by the axis.  In filament-based printers, the head consists of several sub-components that work together to prepare and deliver plastic precisely to the model.  These components are commonly organized into two groups referring to their operating temperature; the **hot end** and the **cold end**.


#### Cold end
Filament fed into the printer first passes through the cold end components.  The first component is the extruder drive.  The extruder drive pushes plastic filament through the rest of the print head.  A common extruder drive design uses a gear and a wheel where the filament is pinched between the two and a motor attached to the gear drives the filament through at a precise rate.

![](images/chapter_1/extruder.jpg)

The second component of the coldcend is a barrel which guides the filament to the hot end components.  On some printers, this barrel is short and the extruder drive is coupled directly to the hot-end and the whole unit moves along the printer's axis.  Another design (often refereed to as the **Bowden** design) uses a long tube to connect a stationary extruder drive to the moving hot-end components.  The advantage of the Bowden configuration is that heavy components of the extruder drive (motor, gears, etc.) do not have to be supported and moved by the printers axis.  This means the axis construction doesn't need to be as heavy-duty (making it less expensive) and it can move faster (resulting in higher quality and shorter print times) because it has less work to do.  On the flip side the Bowden arrangement has the disadvantage in that by having a longer piece of filament between the drive gear and the nozzle it can become more "springy" and harder to control precisely.

#### Hot end
Once the filament drive has pushed the filament through the cold end components, it enters the hot end and passes through several components on its way to the print bed.  The first is the barrel of the hot end; this can be a continuation of the cold end barrel (in a non-Bowden design) or it can be a separate component joined to the cold end via an extended tube as described above.  The barrel guides the filament into the heater, where the plastic is liquifed in preparation to being extruded through the nozzle.  The nozzle has a precision-machined hole that allows a very specific amount of plastic to be extruded; the smaller the hole the finer the details of the print can be.

It is important to preserve the temperature difference between these two sections.  If heat is allowed to creep from the hot end to the cold end, the filament will expand or melt too early in the process and get jammed.  If the hot end does not maintain a high enough temperature, the liquid plastic will freeze in the nozzle and jam as well.  The temperature difference between the hot end and the cold end can be hundreds of degrees, so much of the engineering work that goes into designing these components has been to create designs capable of separating these two zone reliably.

INSERT RESIN PRINTER ILLUSTRATION

There is another type of print head that is very different from those described above.  A resin-based printer has none of the components while effectively maintaining a print head in the form of light that strikes the resin, turning it from liquid to solid.  Without the mass of motors and gears, a resin printer's head can move much faster and more precisely than an extrusion-based printer.  Resin printer speed is limited by the time it takes the resin to transition from liquid to solid, making resin-based printers generally much slower than extrusion-based printers.  However, the resolution of a resin-based printer is generally much higher than an extrusion-based printer.  In practice, there are mechanical parts that limit the resolution in most resin-based desings, but they still commonly exceed the resolution of extrusion-based printers by an order of magnitude.


### Axis
As mentioned above the print head rides along the printer's axis to position the head where material is needed.  The original Reprap designs used three linear axes to move the printhead along the X, Y and Z dimensions.  The X and Y are similar to a 2D printer, and the Z axis simply moves the X and Y axis away from the print bed as each layer is laid down.

![The Mendel Reprap design has a moving carriage for the X axis and moves the bed itself for the Y](images/chapter_1/prusa_axis.jpg)

Recently new axis types have emerged from the Reprap project desiged to improve performance (more printing, less waiting), reduce complexity (easier to build and more reliable) or by minimize the amount of non-printable parts required to build the printer (which makes the printer more self-reproducable).

### Bed
The bed is where the model is built.  The first layer of the print is laid-down on the print bed, and subsequent layers are then added to the previous ones.  In most designs the print bed forms the printer's Y or Z axis, allowing the printed plastic to move under the print head.  Two key attributes of the bed are that it is "tram" with the nozzle, meaning that in any position the nozzle is always the same distance from the surface of the bed (sometimes referred to as "level", although it has nothing to do with being level with the ground), and that it is adhesive, so the printed plastic to stick to the bed and stay in place.

Beds that move in the Y axis are somewhat simpler to design, but moving the entire print back and forth can shake larger (especially tall) models loose during printing.  Beds that move in the Z axis have gravity on their side, and are less likely to cause an adhesion failure, but they are more complex to design because it requires that the the X and Y axes be combined, and can take up more space relative to their build capacity (if the bed is the Y axis, it can extend beyond the frame of the printer while printing).

![](images/chapter_1/bed.jpg)

Depending on the materials used, some print beds are heated to reduce curling that can happen as the extruded plastic cools and shrinks.  When cooling happens at different rates in a print, it can cause the corners or edges of the base of a print to lift-up from the bed, distorting the model and increasing the chances of it coming loose from the bed.


### Electronics

![](images/chapter_1/electronics.jpg)

The electronics are the brains of the printer.  Most 3D printers are controlled and monitored by full-size desktop and laptop computers, or by little computers like the Raspberry Pi that are built into the printer itself.  In addition to the computers that are used to monitor and control the printer, 3D printers require specialized, dedicated processors that can respond on their own to information being supplied constantly during the print process from temperature and other sensors and in turn control motors, heaters, etc.  When discussing the printer's "electronics" these special, dedicated processors and their associated components are what we're referring to.

For the most part you don't have to worry about the electronics once they have been configured, so if you're working with an off-the-shelf printer you might not even know they are there.  If you're building a printer, you'll minimally need to perform the initial configuration of the electronics and install the firmware, which is the software that runs on the electronics and directly controls the printers hardware.  The firmware also manages the communication between the printer and the computer you use to upload models and control the printer during the printing process.  Using firmware (as opposed to hard-wired components) makes the printer more upgradable, allowing you to add new features or improve existing ones.
